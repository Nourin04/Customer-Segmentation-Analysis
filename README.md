# 🎯 **Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-Means Clustering**

This project performs customer segmentation using **K-Means Clustering** on a mall customer dataset. The analysis helps businesses understand customer groups based on **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score**. Visualization techniques like the **Elbow Method** and **3D clustering** are used to determine optimal customer clusters.

## 📊 **Dataset Description**

The dataset `Mall_Customers.csv` contains the following columns:

| Column Name             | Description                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| CustomerID               | Unique ID assigned to each customer  |
| Gender                   | Gender of the customer (Male/Female) |
| Age                      | Age of the customer (in years)       |
| Annual Income (k$)       | Annual income of the customer (in $1000) |
| Spending Score (1-100)   | Score assigned by the mall based on spending behavior |

## 📈 **Results & Insights**

- The **Elbow Method** helps determine the optimal number of clusters (usually where the graph forms an "elbow").
- The 3D visualization reveals distinct clusters based on:
  - **Age groups** (e.g., young vs. older customers)
  - **Income levels** (e.g., high-income spenders vs. low-income savers)
  - **Spending behavior** (e.g., high-spenders vs. low-spenders)

## 🚀 **Technologies Used**

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** → Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** → Machine learning algorithms (K-Means)
- **Seaborn** → Data visualization (optional)

---

## 🏆 **Future Improvements**

- Add more features such as customer occupation, region, or frequency of mall visits.
- Use advanced clustering techniques like **DBSCAN** or **Hierarchical Clustering**.
- Build an interactive web app using **Streamlit** for real-time analysis.
